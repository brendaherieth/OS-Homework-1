Upon initiation, the application welcomes the user with a concise menu comprising fundamental shell commands: dir, cd, echo, and type.

Subsequently, the user is prompted to input a number ranging from 1 to 6, dictating the execution of a corresponding shell command.

Upon inputting 1, the application promptly displays the contents of the present directory.

Selection of 2 triggers the application to exhibit the current directory path.

Opting for 3 initiates the creation of a novel directory as per the user's specifications.

Selection of 4 prompts the user to furnish an input message, subsequently showcased by the application.

Upon choosing 5, the application merges the contents of two designated files.

This iterative process persists until the user elects to conclude operations by entering 6, thereby exiting the program altogether.

Each of the aforementioned shell operations is orchestrated utilizing system functions, facilitating seamless integration and execution within the C++ environment.
